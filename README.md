# Form builder


## Getting started

### Install

### Test

Run the tests suite with:

    $ npm test

> * Node v4+ is required.
> * A `travis.yml` file is provided to enable tests on TravisCI in one click!


### Publish

In order to publish the application on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/),
you just need to run:

    $ npm run publish

If you want to check the content of the `build/` folder before publishing, or
host it somewhere else yourself, just run instead:

    $ npm run build


### Get some more

For example, let us setup [Less](http://lesscss.org/):

    $ git merge boilerplate/setup-css-less

Once merged, the dev server will be auto-refreshed when the `style.less` is modified!
